Final Project: How to Submit
===============================

Go [back to home page](./index.html)
Go to [project requirements page](./requirements.html)

[Overview](#overview) | [Folder Structure](#folders) 

This page contains information how and where to submit your final projects for the course. Please read this information carefully.


<a name="overview"></a>Overview
---------------------------------------

To submit your final project, you will submit pull requests to this repo that add the contents of your project to your designated folder. An instructor will view the pull request and accept it as long as it **only alters the sub-folder associated with your team / project**. Any pull request that violates this rule or any of the conventions below might be rejected.

On this page, you will use a simple example. Let's suppose our team signed up for the **fourth algorithm** in the list of algorithm options, and our algorithm topic is **coin change**. 

If you need to refer to the project requirements or the specific deliverables for the project, then please go read the [project requirements](./requirements.html) page.

<a name="folders"></a>Folder Structure
---------------------------------------

All projects will be submitted under the **projects directory**. In that directory you will find a folder that is labeled with your algorithm number / name combination. For our example, this would be **./projects/04-coinchange/**. Everything you submit for your project should reside in your project's specific subfolder. 

Note the **index.md** file in your root directory. This file will be preplaced in your directory and simply provides links to your various resources / submissions. You will need to go through that file and update any file names that you submitted that do not match.
