<p>This page contains the project requirements. Please make sure you
read this page very carefully and adhere to everything.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-project-deliverables"><a name="summary"></a>Summary
of Project Deliverables</h2>
<p>To complete this project, you will produce multiple deliverables. You
will push each of these deliverables to this Github Repository. The
deliverables are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Executive Summary</strong>: 4-8 page description of
everything that has been delivered in this packet / project.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: In C++, Java, and Python. The code
needs to be thoroughly commented.</li>
<li><strong>Instructional Slides</strong>: Two sets of instructional
slides. The first, a thorough, well designed, informative slideset that
briefly teach the topic to an advanced undergraduate audience (about one
lecture or 10-15 slides in length). A second, shorter, set of slides
will be submitted that will be used for your 10 minute
presentation.</li>
<li><strong>PC: Custom Programming Challenge</strong>: A programming
assignment that asks students to use the algorithm in question, but with
at least one notable twist / change to the topic / algorithm in
question.</li>
<li><strong>PC Test Cases</strong>: At least 20 test cases that cover
likely edge cases and test for speed / efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>PC Solution</strong>: A solution to your custom PC in all
three languages (C++, Java, Python).</li>
</ol>
<p>You can find more detail about each of the requirements below.</p>
<h2 id="executive-summary"><a name="execsummary"></a>Executive
Summary</h2>
<p>Your <strong>executive summary</strong> will be a 4-8 page pdf that
summarizes ALL of the information in your final project. It will serve
as an initial resource for readers to understand the topic / problem you
are addressing, how you solve it, how you designed your programming
challenge, etc.</p>
<p>There is no strict page minimum or maximum for this document. When
writing your exective summary, you should make sure to include ALL of
the following sub-sections, clearly labeled:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction / Problem Statement</strong>: Describe and
motivate the topic your final project is focused on. Some topics will be
focused on <strong>broad algorithmic approaches</strong> (e.g., Dynamic
Programming) and some topics will be <strong>specific
algorithms</strong> (e.g., Quicksort). Either way, you should describe
what problem is being addressed. What is the weakness in other
approaches that necessitates this topic? What is the target runtime (if
applicable)? What are the primary challenges that need to be addressed?
After reading this section, the reader should understand the nature of
the problem and what the goals are.</li>
<li><strong>Overall Intuitive Approach / Solution</strong>: Describe the
solution / algorithm at a high-level. Focus on the key ideas that are
necessary to solve the problem. Include graphics and code-snippets where
appropriate. Remember that your goal is to explain the approach at a
senior-undergraduate level, but you should assume the reader has NOT
already studied this topic. Do not dive directly into the details. This
section might look slightly different depending on the nature of your
topic. For a <strong>broad algorithmic approach</strong>, you might
describe the approach in general and provide a simple example problem.
For a <strong>specific algorithm</strong> project, you will probably
focus on the solution for that one algorithm instead. This section
should NOT contain all of the intuition details.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: Discuss the algorithmic and
implementation details for your topic / algorithm. Include code or
pseudocode if appropriate. This section should have enough detail that a
reader can proceed to implement the algorithm or apply the general
algorithmic approach after reading.</li>
<li><strong>Summary of Programming Challenge</strong>: Summarize the
programming challange that you developed. We are particularly interested
in a <strong>high-level description of what the learning
objectives</strong> of your programming assignment are, and why you
think your assignment achieves them. You should also focus on the
<strong>key twist / idea</strong>, that goes beyond the basic topic,
that is required to complete your assignment. Remember that finding a
good level of additional challenge is important. Problems that go far
beyond what can reasonably be expected from an average upperclass
undergraduate student will incur grade penalties.</li>
<li><strong>Key Ideas for Solving Programming Challenge</strong>:
Describe the key ideas for solving your programming challenge. What are
the main challenges to overcome? Why do you believe these changes are
interesting, but not too difficult? What is the complexity of the model
solution and why?</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Briefly wrap up the document by
summarizing all of the information that was contained in your summary
and provide proper closure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementation"><a name="implementation"></a>Implementation</h2>
<p>You will <strong>create / provide a working implementation that
showcases your topic</strong> in three different programming languages
(C++, Java, Python). If your topic is a <strong>general algorithmic
approach</strong>, then you will need to choose a simple,
straightforward example of applying that approach. Make sure to describe
in your executive summary what the problem statement for this example
is.</p>
<p>In addition to providing working solutions in all three programming
languages, you will <strong>write a couple of simple, small sample test
cases</strong> that we can easily run on your code to verify that it
works on small examples. You should have <strong>at least three test
cases</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, to showcase your understanding of the code / algorithm, and
to assist other students who read your code, you will comment the code
(in all three languages) extensively. You should have a detailed comment
for each block of 3-5 lines of code. Every comment should meaningfully
interpret your code intuitively, not simply translate exactly what the
code states. For example, don’t say things like “sets x to 5 times the
value of y”, say things like “multiply x by 5 to calculate the maximum
value the solution could possibly be”.</p>
<h2 id="instructional-slides"><a name="slides"></a>Instructional
Slides</h2>
<p>You will develop <strong>two sets of instructional slides</strong>
that teach your topic / algorithm in a <strong>college, lecture
format</strong>. The first set of slides will be traditional set of
lecture slides, that provide a thorough overview of the algorithm with
details, code, examples, visuals, etc. This set should be about 10-15
slides in length and would take approximate one traditional college
lecture to deliver to an audience.</p>
<p>Your second slide deck will be used for your <strong>class
presentation</strong> and will be delivered in a maximum of <strong>10
minutes</strong>. For many topics, you will not be able to completely
cover all details of your topic in this limited amount of time. Your
slides (and eventually your presentation) should cover as much detail as
you reasonably can comfortably within the time limit. For some topics,
this might be very detailed and for others this might be more surface /
high level. We would expect this second eck to have somewhere between
5-8 slides.</p>
<p>Both sets of slides should prioritize <strong>showing, over
telling</strong>. In other words, try to maximize your use of images,
tables, graphs, code snippets, etc. over text boxes. An undergraduate
student should be capable of reading your executive summary above, and
then using your slides to teach the topic. Your slides should cover
everything regarding your topic including the motivation, the overall
approach, the implementation, and the analysis. You <strong>do not need
to cover</strong> your programming challenge and solution in your slide
decks.</p>
<h2 id="programming-challenge"><a name="pc"></a>Programming
Challenge</h2>
<p>Produce a 1-2 page pdf (similar to our homework assignments in class)
that present a <strong>programming challenge</strong> to students that
involves the application / implementation of your topic. When doing
this, you should consider what the learning obectives of your
programming challenge are. Do you want students to focus on
implementation of some problem and getting correct inputs / outputs? Do
you want to focus on experimentation / tweaking / playing around with
the algorithm? Do you want to do some kind of comparison with a related
algorithm? All of this is up to you. However, the assignment should be
clearly stated.</p>
<p>Your programming challenge needs to involve some twist / extension on
the topic / algorithm you are studying. You will lose points if your
programming challenge is simply a naive and direct application of your
topic / algorithm. You can run this by course staff if you unsure if
your “extension” is significant or interesting enough.</p>
<h2 id="pc-test-cases"><a name="testcases"></a>PC: Test Cases</h2>
<p>To whatever extent is relevant, you will provide <strong>at least 20
test cases</strong> that test the edge cases and efficiency of solutions
for your programming challenge. Your test cases should be clearly named,
so that it is obvious which files are the inputs, which are the output,
and which inputs map to which outputs.</p>
<h2 id="pc-solution"><a name="solution"></a>PC: Solution</h2>
<p>You will implement a solution to your programming challenge in three
programming languages (C++, Java, Python). As before, you will comment
your solution thoroughly (see <a
href="#implementation">Implementation</a> section above for more
detail).</p>
