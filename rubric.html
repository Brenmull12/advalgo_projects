<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Executive Summary</strong></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Presentation</td>
<td>Document looks professional and does not contain spelling mistakes,
casual speech / grammar, or other issues</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Length</td>
<td>Document is an appropriate length, covering all of the content that
was requested</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Introduction</td>
<td>The introduction frames / motivates the problem and makes it clear
to the reader what the need for the algorithm is, including desired
runtimes if appropriate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Overall Approach</td>
<td>This section describes the overall algorithm at a high level. This
is written at an advanced undergraduate level, but does not dig into the
details just yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Implementation</td>
<td>Clearly and logically describes the algorithm in an understandable
way. Builds components necessary for the algorithm in an intuitive order
and provides examples where necessary to support the intuition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Summary of Programming Challenge</td>
<td>The summary of the programming challenge is clear, intuitive, and
offers at least some “twist” on the main algorithm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>PC Key Ideas</td>
<td>The document summarizes the key ideas for solving the PC in a clear
and understandable way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Conclusion</td>
<td>Document concludes in a reasonable way by connecting everything
together and concluding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Basic Implementations</strong></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Three Implementations</td>
<td>All three language implementations were submitted and are
present</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Test Cases</td>
<td>At least three simple test cases are present that show off the
algorithms capabilities</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Test Case (2)</td>
<td>The test cases are non-trivial enough to show the algorithm working
in a somewhat interesting way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Output</td>
<td>The correct output is provided for each sample test case in a
different text file</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>3</td>
<td>Execution</td>
<td>All three languages run and produce the correct output on all three
test cases (1 pt per language)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>3</td>
<td>Comments</td>
<td>The code is commented thoroughly in a way that helps an upperclass
undergraduate understand the implementation more fully (1 pt per
language)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Instructional Slides</strong></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Submission</td>
<td>Two sets of instructional slides have been submitted</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Lec. Slides Format</td>
<td>Lecture slides are of appropriate length (10-15 slides) and are
professionally formatted (no spelling mistakes, looks professional,
etc.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Lec. Slides Content</td>
<td>Lecture slides adequetely cover the algorithm topic in a sensible
order. These slides could be used in an undergraduate level lecture
immediately</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Lec. Slides Mode</td>
<td>Lecture slides have limited text, and prioritize visuals / showing
students the content over telling. Slides should contain visuals, code
snippets, example executions of the algorithm, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Pres. Slides Format</td>
<td>Lecture slides are of appropriate length (5-8 slides) and are
professionally formatted (no spelling mistakes, looks professional,
etc.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Pres. Slides Content</td>
<td>Lecture slides adequetely cover the algorithm topic in a sensible
order. Slides can be delivered in 10 minutes and cover topic at
appropriate level of detail given the constrained time limit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Pres. Slides Mode</td>
<td>Lecture slides have limited text, and prioritize visuals / showing
students the content over telling. Slides should contain visuals, code
snippets, example executions of the algorithm, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Presentation</strong></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Time Limit</td>
<td>Team delivered presentation in 10 minutes or less</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Speakers</td>
<td>Each team member spoke and delivered a non-trivial piece of the
presentation (e.g., you will lose this point if any team member only
does the introduction slide)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>4</td>
<td>Content</td>
<td>Each speaker (one point per speaker) delivers content adequetely
showing fluency of the material (minor mistakes or nervousness are ok
and understandable)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Depth of Presentation</td>
<td>Presentation describes algorithm at a depth that reasonable for 10
minutes. Some algorithms can be completely covered in 10 mins, others
will be more surface level. However, the depth of the presentation
should be as much as possible given time limit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Custom Programming Challenge</strong></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Document</td>
<td>Document is clear, professional, and unambiguously written (minor
ambiguities might be understandable)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Twist</td>
<td>Programming challenge contains a “twist” that prevents the solution
from being a direct application of the algorithm in question (similar to
some of our PCs this semester)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Sample Cases</td>
<td>Simple sample test cases are given in the assignment writeup that
make clear how input and output will be delivered / handled</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>3</td>
<td>Solution</td>
<td>Solution is provided in all three programming languages</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Test Cases</td>
<td>At least 20 test cases are provided that test a range of input
sizes, edge cases, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Solution Execution</td>
<td>All solutions seem to produce correct results on all test cases</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Solution Comments</td>
<td>Comments in the solution are provided that make clear to other
students (learners) how the code works. Your code should be
understandable to an average upperclass undergraduate student. Esoteric
code patterns are highly discouraged</td>
